#  Cat Vs Dog classification

A Deep Learning Model which used for classification of Cat and Dog. The Accuracy it reach upto 95%. It train on 25000 data where 12500 is cat images and 12500 is dog images.


## Info

1) "MyModel.h5" has reached to the accuracy upto 55% with 1 channel image run for 17 epochs. Shape it used is (1,40,40,1)

2) "cat_n_dog.h5" has reached to the accuracy upto 95% with 3 channel image run for 35 epochs. Shape it used is (1,40,40,3)

Loss :- Sparse_categorical_crossentropy

Activatiion on last layer :- softmax

Hence, Both are train on a fixed image size that is 40px / 40px
